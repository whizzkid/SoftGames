{"intro":"Here's my assignment.\nIn my first chat I was asked about working in other peoples code/framework... \nSo I decided as an extra challenge to use pixi 7, which I haven't really used before, and pixi.js's own 'Open Games' as a framework (and its code-linting settings) since they claim thats what the 'professionals' use.\n\nI now regret my decision :) this framework is kinda bad, and there are bugs (especially in the loading of the assetbundles, which I had to fix) \n\nSo a little disclaimer: The screen management is taken from 'Open Games'.\nScreens are created upon first use, and hidden when you navigate to a new page. The pages is not destroyed, but are kept in memory for future reuse.\n- I am not a fan...\n\nI hope you like what I've made.\n\nAnd please keep in mind, I am not a graphics guy, so I did my best with the fire ;)\n\nCard graphics are from https://cazwolf.itch.io/pixel-fantasy-cards "}
